# Dr. Mongo

The Meteor-based Mongo database manager.

## Installation

Dr. Mongo runs as a separate Meteor application, so you need to have Meteor installed, first. Follow instructions here: https://www.meteor.com/install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/DrMongo/DrMongo.git
$ cd DrMongo
$ meteor --port 3040
```
Your Dr. Mongo instance has to be running along with your other (development) Meteor apps, so we use port 3040, but you are free to use any port.

Once your app is running, go to: http://127.0.0.1:3040
